With the Byteplant Phone Validator plugin you can easily verify if a phone number is really valid and callable (http://www.phone-validator.net).

== Description ==

This plugin uses the Byteplant Phone-Validator API (http://www.phone-validator.net) to check if a phone number is really valid and callable.

The plugin works seamlessly with:
* Contact Form 7
* WooCommerce

The plugin can also be integrated into any 3rd party form.

How does it work?

The Phone-Validator real-time validation API provides detailed information for each phone number:
* Status: VALID/CONFIRMED, VALID/UNCONFIRMED or INVALID
* Line type: FIXED_LINE, MOBILE, VOIP etc.
* Geolocation: Region and city
* Phone number correction and re-formatting according to national and international standards

The plugin requires an API Key (free, no credit card required):

During the entire validation process, the phone number is not contacted in any way, nor will any phones connected to a line ring.
